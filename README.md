# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction project is an initiative aimed at leveraging machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on a variety of health-related features. Given the significant impact of cardiovascular diseases on global health, early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical. This project utilizes a dataset containing essential medical attributes, including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

By employing data preprocessing techniques, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to build a robust predictive model that can effectively classify individuals as at risk or not at risk of heart disease. The project explores various algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC score.

The insights gained from this analysis not only enhance the understanding of the factors contributing to heart disease but also serve as a decision-support tool for healthcare professionals. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to facilitate timely interventions and improve patient outcomes through data-driven insights into heart health.
